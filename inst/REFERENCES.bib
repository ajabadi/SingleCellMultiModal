  abstract = "Formation of the three primary germ layers during gastrulation is
              an essential step in the establishment of the vertebrate body
              plan and is associated with major transcriptional changes1-5.
              Global epigenetic reprogramming accompanies these changes6-8, but
              the role of the epigenome in regulating early cell-fate choice
              remains unresolved, and the coordination between different
              molecular layers is unclear. Here we describe a single-cell
              multi-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and
              RNA expression during the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos.
              The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the
              establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape,
              followed by the emergence of lineage-specific epigenetic patterns
              during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and
              endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements
              at enhancer marks, driven by ten-eleven translocation
              (TET)-mediated demethylation and a concomitant increase of
              accessibility. By contrast, the methylation and accessibility
              landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early
              epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ
              layer are either epigenetically primed or remodelled before
              cell-fate decisions, providing the molecular framework for a
              hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers.",
